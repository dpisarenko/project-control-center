entrywindow.15-theProblemText = <p>Project Control Center application helps people, who work on lots of \
different projects to use their precious time most effectively.</p> \
<p>If you have a full-time job and some part-time activity (building your own business, art \
or children), you may lose time in following ways:</p> \
<ol>\
<li>Not knowing what to do at the current moment</li> \
<li>Forgetting priorities</li> \
<li>Working too much</li>\
</ol>\
<h1>The solution</h1>\
<p>Project control center solves all of these problems by automatically generating daily to-do lists for you.\
It works in three simple steps:\
First, you enter the projects you want to accomplish (including priorities, effort \
estimates and dependencies) into your Google Calendar to-do list.</p>\

# Next, you login to the Project Control Center application and press the "Calculate the plan" button.<br/>\
# Project control center calculates, when you have to work on what task and in what order. It also \
# takes into account the available time so that the workload is distribute evenly over the time.<br/>\
# Finally, these data are exported into your Google Calendar.<br/>\
# Whenever your plans change (e. g. a task is completed, you shift your priorities\
# or add new tasks) you can re-calculate these working times and update your schedule.<br/>\
# All with a single click of a button!\
# Next step\
# Do you feel that this application can make your life easier? Currently, it \
# is in private beta and I need people, who would try to use it and give me their feedback.\
# If you want to do this, contact me, <a href=http://altruix.co/>Dmitri Pisarenko</a> and I \
# will give you access to the application.\
# Or, simply enter your e-mail into the invitation request box below.
